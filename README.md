# ADRPredict-AI-Powered-Adverse-Drug-Reaction-Prediction-Tool


Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) remain a critical challenge in drug
development, impacting patient safety and regulatory approvals. This project,
ADRPredict: AI-Powered Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction Tool, addresses this
issue by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to predict ADRs using
clinical trial data. The tool integrates comprehensive datasets, to process clinical
trial information, drug properties, and anonymized patient data.


The methodology focuses on thorough data preprocessing, employing natural
language processing (NLP) for text-based ADR reports and advanced feature
engineering to account for patient demographics, risk factors etc. Various machine
learning models like Random Forest, as well as deep learning architectures such
as RNN, are explored to develop a robust multi-label classification system that
predicts multiple ADRs for a medical condition.


Validation metrics like precision, score ensure model reliability.The expected
outcomes include an accurate and scalable tool to enhance drug safety and
decision-making, providing pharmaceutical companies and researchers with
critical insights for safer drug development.

Feature Engineering: Extract patient risk factors and drug properties to enhance prediction accuracy.
Random Forest: Used for feature importance analysis and multi-label classification to predict multiple ADRs for a medical condition.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Applied for text-based ADR prediction using clinical reports.
Holistic Integration: Combines clinical, drug, and demographic data for comprehensive analysis.
Scalable Tool: Designed for generalizability across diverse datasets and user-friendly insights.
